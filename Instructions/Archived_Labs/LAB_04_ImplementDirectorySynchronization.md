## Instructions

### Exercise 1: Deploy an Azure VM hosting an Microsoft Entra ID domain controller

### Estimated timing: 10 minutes

In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Identify an available DNS name for an Azure VM deployment
- Task 2: Use an ARM template to deploy an Azure VM hosting an Microsoft Entra ID domain controller

#### Task 1: Identify an available DNS name for an Azure VM deployment

In this task, you will identify a DNS name for your Azure VM deployment. 

1. Sign-in to the Azure portal **`https://portal.azure.com/`**.

    >**Note**: Sign in to the Azure portal using an account that has the Owner or Contributor role in the Azure subscription you are using for this lab.

2. Open the Cloud Shell by clicking the first icon in the top right of the Azure Portal. If prompted, click **PowerShell** and **Create storage**.

3. Ensure **PowerShell** is selected in the drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of the Cloud Shell pane.

4. In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to identify an available DNS name you can use for an Azure VM deployment in the next task of this exercise:

    ```powershell
    Test-AzDnsAvailability -DomainNameLabel <custom-label> -Location '<location>'
    ```

    >**Note**: Replace the `<custom-label>` placeholder with a valid DNS name that is likely to be globally unique. Replace the `<location>` placeholder with the name of the region into which you want to deploy the Azure VM that will host the Active Directory domain controller you will use in this lab.

    >**Note**: To identify Azure regions where you can provision Azure VMs, refer to [**https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/offers/**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/offers/)

5. Verify that the command returned **True**. If not, rerun the same command with a different value of the `<custom-label>` until the command returns **True**.

6. Record the value of the `<custom-label>` that resulted in the successful outcome. You will need it in the next task.

7. Close the Cloud Shell.

#### Task 2: Use an ARM template to deploy an Azure VM hosting an Microsoft Entra ID domain controller

In this task, you will deploy an Azure VM that will host an Microsoft Entra ID domain controller

1. Open another browser tab in the same browser window and navigate to the **https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/application-workloads/active-directory/active-directory-new-domain**.

2. On the **Create an Azure VM with a new AD Forest** page, click **Deploy to Azure**. This will automatically redirect the browser to the **Create an Azure VM with a new AD Forest** blade in the Azure portal. 

3. On the **Create an Azure VM with a new AD Forest** blade, click **Edit parameters**.

4. On the **Edit parameters** blade, click **Load file**, in the **Open** dialog box, navigate to the folder **\\\\AllFiles\Labs\\06\\active-directory-new-domain\\azuredeploy.parameters.json**, click **Open**, and then click **Save**.

5. On the **Create an Azure VM with a new AD Forest** blade, specify the following settings (leave others with their existing values):

   |Setting|Value|
   |---|---|
   |Subscription|the name of you Azure subscription|
   |Resource group|click **Create new** and type the name **AZ500LAB06**|
   |Region|the Azure region you identified in the previous task|
   |Admin Username|**Student**|
   |Admin Password|**Please use your personal password created in Lab 02 > Exercise 1 > Task 1 > Step 9.**|
   |Domain Name|**adatum.com**|
   |Dns Prefix|the DNS hostname you identified in the previous task|
   |VM Size|**Standard_D2s_v3**|

6. On the **Create an Azure VM with a new AD Forest** blade, click **Review + create**, and then click **Create**.

    >**Note**: Do not wait for the deployment to complete but instead proceed to the next exercise. The deployment might take about 15 minutes. You will use the virtual machine deployed in this task in the third exercise of this lab.

> Result: After you completed this exercise, you have initiated deployment of an Azure VM that will host a Microsoft Entra ID domain controller by using an Azure Resource Manager template


### Exercise 2: Create and configure an Microsoft Entra tenant 

### Estimated timing: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Create a Microsoft Entra tenant
- Task 2: Add a custom DNS name to the new Microsoft Entra tenant
- Task 3: Create a Microsoft Entra ID user with the Global Administrator role

#### Task 1: Create a Microsoft Entra tenant

In this task, you will create a new Microsoft Entra tenant to use in this lab. 

1. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box at the top of the Azure portal page, type **Microsoft Entra ID** and press the **Enter** key.

2. On the blade displaying **Overview** of your current Microsoft Entra tenant, click **Manage tenants**, and then on the next screen, click **+ Create**.

3. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create a tenant** blade, ensure that the option **Microsoft Entra ID** is selected and click **Next: Configuration >**.

4. On the **Configuration** tab of the **Create a directory** blade, specify the following settings:

   |Setting|Value|
   |---|---|
   |Organization name|**AdatumSync**|
   |Initial domain name|a unique name consisting of a combination of letters and digits|
   |Country or region|**United States**|

    >**Note**: Record the initial domain name. You will need it later in this lab.

    >**Note**: The green check mark in the **Initial domain name** text box will indicate whether the domain name you typed in is valid and unique. (Record your initial domain name for later use).

5. Click **Review + create** and then click **Create**.

    >**Note**: Wait for the new tenant to be created. Use the **Notification** icon to monitor the deployment status. 

#### Task 2: Add a custom DNS name to the new Azure AD tenant

In this task, you will add your custom DNS name to the new Azure AD tenant. 

1. In the Azure portal, in the toolbar, click the **Directory + subscription** icon, located to the right of the Cloud Shell icon. 

2. In the **Directory + subscription** blade, select the newly created tenant **AdatumSync** line and click the **Switch** button.

    >**Note**: You may need to refresh the browser window if the **AdatumSync** entry does not appear in the **Directory + subscription** filter list.

3. On the **AdatumSync \| Microsoft Entra ID** blade, in the **Manage** section, click **Custom domain names**.

4. On the **AdatumSync \| Custom domain names** blade, click **+ Add custom domain**.

5. On the **Custom domain name** blade, in the **Custom domain name** text box, type **adatum.com** and click **Add Domain**.

6. On the **adatum.com** blade, review the information necessary to perform verification of the Microsoft Entra domain name and then select **Delete** twice. 

    >**Note**: You will not be able to complete the validation process because you do not own the **adatum.com** DNS domain name. This will not prevent you from synchronizing the **adatum.com** Microsoft Entra Domain Services domain with the Microsoft Entra tenant. You will use for this purpose the initial DNS name of the Microsoft Entra tenant (the name ending with the **onmicrosoft.com** suffix), which you identified in the previous task. However, keep in mind that, as a result, the DNS domain name of the Microsoft Entra Domain Services domain and the DNS name of the Microsoft Entra tenant will differ. This means that Adatum users will need to use different names when signing in to the Microsoft Entra Domain Services domain and when signing in to Microsoft Entra tenant.

#### Task 3: Create an Microsoft Entra ID user with the Global Administrator role

In this task, you will add a new Microsoft Entra ID user and assign them to the Global Administrator role. 

1. On the **AdatumSync** Microsoft Entra tenant blade, in the **Manage** section, click **Users**.

2. On the **Users | All users** blade, click **+ New User** and then **Create new user**.

3. On the **New user** blade, ensure that the **Create user** option is selected, specify the following settings on the Basics tab (leave all others with their default values) and click **Next: Properties >**:

   |Setting|Value|
   |---|---|
   |User name|**syncadmin**|
   |Name|**syncadmin**|
   |Password|ensure that the option **Auto-generate password** is selected and click **Show Password**|

    >**Note**: Record the full user name. You can copy its value by clicking the **Copy to clipboard** button on the right-hand side of the drop-down list displaying the domain name and pasting it into a notepad document. You will need this later in this lab.

    >**Note**: Record the user's password by clicking the **Copy to clipboard** button on the right-hand side of the Password text box and pasting it into a notepad document. You will need this later in this lab.

4. On the **Properties** tab, scroll to the bottom and specify the Usage Location: **United States** (leave all others with their default values) and click **Next: Assignments >**.

5. On the **Assignments** tab, click **+ Add role**, search for and select **Global Administrator**, and then click **Select**. Click **Review + create** and then click **Create**.
   
    >**Note**: An Azure AD user with the Global Administrator role is required in order to implement Microsoft Entra Connect.

6. Open an InPrivate browser window.

7. Navigate to the Azure portal at **`https://portal.azure.com/`** and sign in using the **syncadmin** user account. When prompted, change the password you recorded earlier in this task to your own password that meets the complexity requirements and record it for future reference. You will be prompted for this password in later tasks.

    >**Note**: To sign in you will need to provide a fully qualified name of the **syncadmin** user account, including the Microsoft Entra tenant DNS domain name, which you recorded earlier in this task. This user name is in the format syncadmin@`<your_tenant_name>`.onmicrosoft.com, where `<your_tenant_name>` is the placeholder representing your unique Microsoft Entra tenant name. 

8. Sign out as **syncadmin** and close the InPrivate browser window.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have created an AMicrosoft Entra tenant, seen how to add a custom DNS name to the new Microsoft Entra tenant, and created an Azure AD user with the Global Administrator role.


### Exercise 3: Synchronize Microsoft Entra ID forest with a Microsoft Entra tenant

    ```
11. Close the **Cloud Shell** pane.

    >**Note**: Finally, remove the Microsoft Entra tenant
    
    >**Note 2**: Deleting a tenant is meant to be a very hard process, so it can never accidentally or maliciously be done.  That means that removing the tenant as part of this lab often does not work.  While we have the steps here to delete the tenant, it is not required to consider yourself as completing this lab. If you ever have a need to remove a tenant in the real world, there are articles on DOCS.Microsoft.com to help you.

12. Back in the Azure portal, use the **Directory + subscription** filter to switch to the **AdatumSync** Microsoft Entra tenant.
