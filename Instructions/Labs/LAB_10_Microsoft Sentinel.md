#### Task 1: On-board Microsoft Sentinel

In this task, you will on-board Microsoft Sentinel and connect the Log Analytics workspace. 

1. Sign-in to the Azure portal **`https://portal.azure.com/`**.

    >**Note**: Sign in to the Azure portal using an account that has the Owner or Contributor role in the Azure subscription you are using for this lab.

2. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box at the top of the Azure portal page, type **Microsoft Sentinel** and press the **Enter** key.

    >**Note**: If this is your first attempt to action Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure dashboard complete the following step(s): In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources,  services, and docs** text box at the top of the Azure portal page, type **Microsoft Sentinel** and press the **Enter** key. Select **Microsoft Sentinel** from the **Services** view.
  
3. On the **Microsoft Sentinel** blade, click **+ Create**.

4. On the **Add Microsoft Sentinel to a workspace** blade, select the Log Analytics workspace you created in the Azure Monitor lab and click **Add**.

    >**Note**: Microsoft Sentinel has very specific requirements for workspaces. For example, workspaces created by Microsoft Defender for Cloud can not be used. Read more at [Quickstart: On-board Microsoft Sentinel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/quickstart-onboard)
	
#### Task 2: Configure Microsoft Sentinel to use the Azure Activity data connector. 

In this task, you will configure Sentinel to use the Azure Activity data connector.  

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Microsoft Sentinel \| Overview** blade, in the **Content management** section, click **Content hub**.

    >**Note**: This may take a few minutes to appear. **Refresh** the page if it does not appear.

7. In the Azure portal, navigate back to the **Microsoft Sentinel \| Overview** blade.

8. On the **Microsoft Sentinel \| Overview** blade, review the dashboard and verify that it displays an incident corresponding to the deletion of the Just-in-time VM access policy.

    >**Note**: It can take up to 5 minutes for alerts to appear on the **Microsoft Sentinel \| Overview** blade. If you are not seeing an alert at that point, run the query rule referenced in the previous task to verify that the Just-in-time access policy deletion activity has been propagated to the Log Analytics workspace associated with your Microsoft Sentinel instance. If that is not the case, re-create the Just-in-time VM access policy and delete it again.

9. On the **Microsoft Sentinel \| Overview** blade, in the **Threat Management** section, click **Incidents**.

10. Verify that the blade displays an incident with either medium or high severity level.

    >**Note**: It can take up to 5 minutes for the incident to appear on the **Microsoft Sentinel \| Incidents** blade. 

    >**Note**: Review the **Microsoft Sentinel \| Playbooks** blade. You will find there the count of succesfull and failed runs.

    >**Note**: You have the option of assigning a different severity level and status to an incident.

> Results: You have created an Microsoft Sentinel workspace, connected it to Azure Activity logs, created a playbook and custom alerts that are triggered in response to the removal of Just-in-time VM access policies, and verified that the configuration is valid.

**Clean up resources**

> Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not incur unexpected costs. 

1. In the Azure portal, open the Cloud Shell by clicking the first icon in the top right of the Azure Portal. If prompted, click **PowerShell** and **Create storage**.

2. Ensure **PowerShell** is selected in the drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of the Cloud Shell pane.
