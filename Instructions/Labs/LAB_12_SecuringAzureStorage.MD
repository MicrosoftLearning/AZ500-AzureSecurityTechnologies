# Lab 12: Service Endpoints and Securing Storage
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You have been asked to create a proof of concept to demonstrate securing Azure file shares. Specifically, you want to:
	
- Create a storage endpoint so traffic destined to Azure Storage always stays within the Azure backbone network.
- Configure the storage endpoint so only resources from a specific subnet can access the storage.
- Confirm that resources outside of the specific subnet cannot access the storage. 

> For all the resources in this lab, we are using the **East US** region. Verify with your instructor this is the region to use for class. 

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following exercise:

- Exercise 1: Service endpoints and security storage

### Exercise 1: Service endpoints and security storage

    |User name|**localadmin**|
    |Password|**Pa55w.rd1234**|

    >**Note**: Wait for the Remote Desktop session to open and Server Manager to load.

    >**Note**: You will now map drive Z to an Azure File share within the Remote Desktop session to a Windows Server 2019 computer

5. Within the Remote Desktop session to **myVMPrivate**, click **Start** and then click **Windows PowerShell ISE**.

6. Within the **Windows PowerShell ISE** window, open the **Script** pane, then paste and run the PowerShell script that you recorded earlier in this lab. The script has the following format:

    ```powershell
    $connectTestResult = Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <storage_account_name>.file.core.windows.net -Port 445
    if ($connectTestResult.TcpTestSucceeded) {
       # Save the password so the drive will persist on reboot
       cmd.exe /C "cmdkey /add:`"<storage_account_name>.file.core.windows.net`" /user:`"Azure\<storage_account_name>`"  /pass:`"<storage_account_key>`""
       # Mount the drive
       New-PSDrive -Name Z -PSProvider FileSystem -Root "\\<storage_account_name>.file.core.windows.net\my-file-share" -Persist
    } else {
       Write-Error -Message "Unable to reach the Azure storage account via port 445. Check to make sure your organization or ISP is not blocking port 445, or use Azure P2S VPN, Azure S2S VPN, or Express Route to tunnel SMB traffic over a different port."
    }
    ```
    >**Note**: The `<storage-account-name>` placeholder represents the name of the storage account hosting the file share and `<storage_account_name>` one its primary key

7. Start File Explorer and verify that the Z: drive mapping has been successfully created.

8. Next, from the console pane of the **Windows PowerShell ISE** console, run the following to verify that the virtual machine has no outbound connectivity to the internet:

    ```powershell
    Test-NetConnection -ComputerName www.bing.com -Port 80
    ```

    >**Note**: The test will fail because the network security group associated with the Private subnet does not allow outbound access to the internet.

9. Terminate the Remote Desktop session to the **myVMPrivate** Azure VM.

    >**Note**: At this point, you have confirmed that the virtual machine in the Private subnet can access the storage account. 

####  Task 7: Test the storage connection from the public subnet to confirm that access is denied 

1. Navigate back to the **Virtual machines** blade. 

2. On the **Virtual machines** blade, click the **myVMPublic** entry.

3. On the **myVMPublic** blade, click **Connect** and, in the drop down menu, click **RDP**. 

4. Click **Download RDP File** and use it to connect to the **myVMPublic** Azure VM via Remote Desktop. When prompted to authenticate, provide the following credntials:

    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |User name|**localadmin**|
    |Password|**Pa55w.rd1234**|

    >**Note**: Wait for the Remote Desktop session to open and Server Manager to load.

    >**Note**: You will now map drive Z to an Azure File share within the Remote Desktop session to a Windows Server 2019 computer

5. Within the Remote Desktop session to **myVMPublic**, click **Start** and then click **Windows PowerShell ISE**.

6. Within the **Windows PowerShell ISE** window, open the **Script** pane, then paste and run the same PowerShell script that you ran within the Remote Desktop session to the **myVMPrivate** Azure VM.

    >**Note**: This time, you will receive the **New-PSDrive : Access is denied** error. 

    >**Note**: Access is denied because the *myVmPublic* virtual machine is deployed in the Public subnet. The Public subnet does not have a service endpoint enabled for the Azure Storage. The storage account only allows network access from the Private subnet.

7. Next, from the console pane of the **Windows PowerShell ISE** console, run the following to verify that the virtual machine has outbound connectivity to the internet: 

    ```powershell
    Test-NetConnection -ComputerName www.bing.com -Port 80
    ```

    >**Note**: The test will succeed because there is no network security group associated with the Public subnet.

8. Terminate the Remote Desktop session to the **myVMPublic** Azure VM.

    >**Note**: At this point, you have confirmed that the virtual machine in the Public subnet cannot access the storage account, but has access to the internet.


**Clean up resources**

> Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not incur unexpected costs. 

1. Open the Cloud Shell by clicking the first icon in the top right of the Azure Portal. If prompted, select **PowerShell** and **Create storage**.

2. Ensure **PowerShell** is selected in the drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of the Cloud Shell pane.

3. In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to remove the resource group you created in this lab:
  
    ```powershell
    Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "AZ500LAB12" -Force -AsJob
    ```

4.  Close the **Cloud Shell** pane.
