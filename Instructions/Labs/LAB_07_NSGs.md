# Lab 07: Network Security Groups and Application Security Groups
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You have been asked to implement your organization's virtual networking infrastructure and test to ensure it is working correctly. In particular:

- The organization has two groups of servers: Web Servers and Management Servers.
- Each group of servers should be in its own Application Security Group. 
- You should be able to RDP into the Management Servers, but not the Web Servers.
- The Web Servers should display the IIS web page when accessed from the internet. 
- Network security group rules should be used to control network access. 

> For all the resources in this lab, we are using the **East US** region. Verify with your instructor this is the region to use for class. 

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following exercises:

- Exercise 1: Create the virtual networking infrastructure
- Exercise 2: Deploy virtual machines and test the network filters

#### Task 3: Associate each virtual machines network interface to its application security group.

In this task, you will associate each virtual machines network interface with the corresponding application security group. The myVMWeb virtual machine interface will be associated to the myAsgWebServers ASG. The myVMMgmt virtual machine interface will be associated to the myAsgMgmtServers ASG. 

1. In the Azure portal, navigate back to the **Virtual machines** blade and verify that both virtual machines are listed with the **Running** status.

2. In the list of virtual machines, click the **myVMWeb** entry.

3. On the **myVMWeb** blade, in the **Settings** section, click **Networking** and then, on the **myVMWeb \| Networking** blade, click the **Application security groups** tab.

4. Click **Configure the application security groups**, in the **Application security group** drop-down list, select **myAsgWebServers**, and then click **Save**.

5. Navigate back to the **Virtual machines** blade and in the list of virtual machines, click the **myVMMgmt** entry.

7. Click **Configure the application security groups**, in the **Application security group** drop-down list, select **myAsgMgmtServers**, and then click **Save**.

#### Task 4: Test the network traffic filtering

In this task, you will test the network traffic filters. You should be able to RDP into the myVMMgmnt virtual machine. You should be able to connect from the internet to the myVMWeb virtual machine and view the default IIS web page.  

1. Navigate back to the **myVMMgmt** virtual machine blade.

2. On the **myVMMgmt** blade, click **Connect** and, in the drop down menu, click **RDP**. 

3. Click **Download RDP File** and use it to connect to the **myVMMgmt** Azure VM via Remote Desktop. When prompted to authenticate, provide the following credntials:

   |Setting|Value|
   |---|---|
   |User name|**Student**|
   |Password|**Pa55w.rd1234**|

    >**Note**: Verify that the Remote Desktop connection was successful. At this point you have confirmed you can connect via Remote Desktop to myVMMgmt.

4. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **myVMWeb** virtual machine blade.

5. On the **myVMWeb** blade, in the **Operations** section, click **Run command** and then click **RunPowerShellScript**.

6. On the **Run Command Script** pane, run the following to install the Web server role on **myVmWeb**:

    ```powershell
    Install-WindowsFeature -name Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools
    ```

    >**Note**: Wait for the installation to complete. This might take a couple of minutes. At that point, you can verify that myVMWeb can be accessed via HTTP/HTTPS.

7. In the Azure portal, navigate back to the **myVMWeb** blade.

8. On the **myVMWeb** blade, identify the **Public IP address** of the myVmWeb Azure VM.

9. Open another browser tab and navigate to IP address you identified in the previous step.

    >**Note**: The browser page should display the default IIS welcome page because port 80 is allowed inbound from the internet based on the setting of the **myAsgWebServers** application security group. The network interface of the myVMWeb Azure VM is associated with that application security group. 

> Result: You have validated that the NSG and ASG configuration is working and traffic is being correctly managed. 

**Clean up resources**

> Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not incur unexpected costs. 

1. Open the Cloud Shell by clicking the first icon in the top right of the Azure Portal. If prompted, select **PowerShell** and **Create storage**.

2. Ensure **PowerShell** is selected in the drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of the Cloud Shell pane.

3. In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to remove the resource group you created in this lab:
  
    ```powershell
    Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "AZ500LAB07" -Force -AsJob
    ```

4.  Close the **Cloud Shell** pane.
