# Lab 14: Azure Monitor

# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You have been asked to collect events and performance counters from virtual machines with Azure Monitor Agent.

> For all the resources in this lab, we are using the **East US** region. Verify with your instructor this is the region to use for class. 

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following exercises:

- Exercise 1: Deploy an Azure virtual machine
- Exercise 2: Create a Log Analytics workspace
- Exercise 3: Create an Azure storage account
- Exercise 4: Create a data colllection rule.

    ```powershell
    New-AzResourceGroup -Name AZ500LAB131415 -Location 'EastUS'
    ```

    >**Note**: This resource group will be used for labs 13, 14, and 15. 

5. In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a new Azure virtual machine. 

    ```powershell
    New-AzVm -ResourceGroupName "AZ500LAB131415" -Name "myVM" -Location 'EastUS' -VirtualNetworkName "myVnet" -SubnetName "mySubnet" -SecurityGroupName   "myNetworkSecurityGroup" -PublicIpAddressName "myPublicIpAddress" -PublicIpSku Standard -OpenPorts 80,3389 -Size Standard_DS1_v2 
    ```
    
6.  When prompted for credentials:

    |Setting|Value|

    |User |**localadmin**|
    |Password|**Please use your personal password created in Lab 05 > Exercise 1 > Task 1 > Step 9.**|

    >**Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete. 

7. In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to confirm that the virtual machine named **myVM** was created and its **ProvisioningState** is **Succeeded**.

    ```powershell
    Get-AzVM -Name 'myVM' -ResourceGroupName 'AZ500LAB131415' | Format-Table
