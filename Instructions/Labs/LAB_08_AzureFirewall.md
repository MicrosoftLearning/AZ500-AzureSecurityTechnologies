# Lab 08: Azure Firewall
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You have been asked to install Azure Firewall. This will help your organization control inbound and outbound network access which is an important part of an overall network security plan. Specifically, you would like to create and test the following infrastructure components:

- A virtual network with a workload subnet and a jump host subnet.
- A virtual machine is each subnet. 
- A custom route that ensures all outbound workload traffic from the workload subnet must use the firewall.
- Firewall Application rules that only allow outbound traffic to www.bing.com. 
- Firewall Network rules that allow external DNS server lookups.

> For all the resources in this lab, we are using the **East US** region. Verify with your instructor this is the region to use for class.

1. On the **Srv-Jump** blade, click **Connect** and, in the drop down menu, click **RDP**. 

1. Click **Download RDP File** and use it to connect to the **Srv-Jump** Azure VM via Remote Desktop. When prompted to authenticate, provide the following credntials:

   |Setting|Value|
   |---|---|
   |User name|**localadmin**|
   |Password|**Pa55w.rd1234**|

    >**Note**: The following steps are performed in the Remote Desktop session to the **Srv-Jump** Azure VM. 

    >**Note**: You will connect to the **Srv-Work** virtual machine. This is being done so we can test the ability to access the bing.com website.  

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **Srv-Jump**, right-click **Start**, in the right-click menu, click **Run**, and, from the **Run** dialog box, run the following to connect to **Srv-Work**. 

    ```
    mstsc /v:Srv-Work
    ```

1. When prompted to authenticate, provide the following credentials:

   |Setting|Value|
   |---|---|
   |User name|**localadmin**|
   |Password|**Pa55w.rd1234**|

    >**Note**: Wait for the Remote Desktop session to be established and the Server Manager interface to load.

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **Srv-Work**, in **Server Manager**, click **Local Server** and then click **IE Enhanced Security Configuration**.

1. In the **Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration** dialog box, set both options to **Off** and click **OK**.

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **Srv-Work**, start Internet Explorer and browse to **`https://www.bing.com`**. 

    >**Note**: The website should successfully display. The firewall allows you access.

1. Browse to **`http://www.microsoft.com/`**

    >**Note**: Within the browser page, you should receive a message with text resembling the following: `HTTP request from 10.0.2.4:xxxxx to microsoft.com:80. Action: Deny. No rule matched. Proceeding with default action.` This is expected, since the firewall blocks access to this website. 

1. Terminate both Remote Desktop sessions.

> Result: You have successfully configured and tested the Azure Firewall.
