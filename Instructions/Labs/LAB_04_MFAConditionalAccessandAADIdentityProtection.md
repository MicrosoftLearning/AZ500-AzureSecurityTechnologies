- Task 1: Deploy an Azure VM by using an Azure Resource Manager template.

#### Task 1: Deploy an Azure VM by using an Azure Resource Manager template

In this task, you will create a virtual machine by using an ARM template. This virtual machine will be used in the last exercise for this lab. 

1. Sign-in to the Azure portal **`https://portal.azure.com/`**.

    >**Note**: Sign in to the Azure portal using an account that has the Owner or Contributor role in the Azure subscription you are using for this lab and the Global Administrator role in the Azure AD tenant associated with that subscription.

2. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box at the top of the Azure portal page, type **Deploy a custom template**.

    >**Note**: You can also select **Template Deployment (deploy using custom templates)** from the **Marketplace** list.

3. On the **Custom deployment** blade, click the **Build your own template in the editor** option.

4. On the **Edit template** blade, click **Load file**, locate the **\\Allfiles\\Labs\\04\\az-500-04_azuredeploy.json** file and click **Open**.

    >**Note**: Review the content of the template and note that it deploys an Azure VM hosting Windows Server 2019 Datacenter.

5. On the **Edit template** blade, click **Save**.

6. Back on the **Custom deployment** blade, click **Edit parameters**.

7. On the **Edit parameters** blade, click **Load file**, locate the **\\Allfiles\\Labs\\04\\az-500-04_azuredeploy.parameters.json** file and click **Open**.

    >**Note**: Review the content of the parameters file noting the adminUsername and adminPassword values.

8. On the **Edit parameters** blade, click **Save**.

9. On the **Custom deployment** blade, ensure that the following settings are configured (leave any others with their default values):

In this task, you will validate the MFA configuration by testing sign in of the aaduser1 user account. 

1. Open an InPrivate browser window.

2. Navigate to the Azure portal and sign in using the **aaduser1** user account. 

    >**Note**: To sign in you will need to provide a fully qualified name of the **aaduser1** user account, including the Azure AD tenant DNS domain name, which you recorded earlier in this lab. This user name is in the format aaduser1@`<your_tenant_name>`.onmicrosoft.com, where `<your_tenant_name>` is the placeholder representing your unique Azure AD tenant name. 

3. When prompted, in the **More information required** dialog box, click **Next**.

    >**Note**: The browser session will be redirected to the **Additional security verification** page.

10. Download and install the Windows version of the ToR Browser with the default settings. 

11. Once the installation completes, start the ToR Browser, use the **Connect** option on the initial page, and browse to the Application Access Panel at [**https://myapps.microsoft.com**](https://myapps.microsoft.com).

12. When prompted, attempt to sign in with the **aaduser3** account. 

    >**Note**: You will be presented with the message **Your sign-in was blocked**. This is expected, since this account is not configured with multi-factor authentication, which is required due to increased sign-in risk associated with the use of ToR Browser.

13. Use the **Sign out and sign in with a different account option** to sign in as **aaduser1** account you created and configured for multi-factor authentication earlier in this lab.

    >**Note**: This time, you will be presented with the **Suspicious activity detected** message. Again, this is expected, since this account is configured with multi-factor authentiation. Considering the increased sign-in risk associated with the use of ToR Browser, you will have to use multi-factor authentication.

14. Use the **Verify** option and specify whether you want to verify your identity via text or a call.

15. Complete the verification and ensure that you successfully signed in to the Application Access Panel.

16. Close your RDP session. 

    >**Note**: At this point, you attempted two different sign ins. Next, you will review the Azure Identity Protection reports.

#### Task 5: Review the Azure AD Identity Protection reports

In this task, you will review the Azure AD Identity Protection reports generated from the ToR browser logins.

1. Back in the Azure portal, use the **Directory + subscription** filter to switch to the **AdatumLab500-04** Azure Active Directory tenant.

7. Under **Reports** click **Risk detections**.

8. Review the report and identify any entries representing the sign-in from anonymous IP address generated by the ToR browser. 

 >**Note**: It may take 10-15 minutes to risks to show up in reports.

> **Result**: You have enabled Azure AD Identity Protection, configured user risk policy and sign-in risk policy, as well as validated Azure AD Identity Protection configuration by simulating risk events.

**Clean up resources**

> We need to remove identity protection resources that you no longer use. 

Use the following steps to disable the identity protection policies in the **AdatumLab500-04** Azure AD tenant.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate back to the **AdatumLab500-04** Azure Active Directory tenant blade.

2. On the **AdatumLab500-04** blade, in the **Manage** section, click **Security**.

6. On the **Identity Protection \| User risk policy** blade, click **Sign-in risk policy**

7. On the **Identity Protection \| Sign-in risk policy** blade, set **Enforce policy** to **Off** and then click **Save**.

Use the following steps to stop the Azure VM you provisioned earlier in the lab.

1. In the Azure portal, set the **Directory + subscription** filter to the the Azure AD tenant associated with the Azure subscription into which you deployed the **az500-04-vm1** Azure VM.

2. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box at the top of the Azure portal page, type **Virtual machines** and press the **Enter** key.

3. On the **Virtual machines** blade, click the **az500-04-vm1** entry. 
 
4. On the **az500-04-vm1** blade, click **Stop** and, when prompted to confirm, click **OK** 

>  Do not remove any resources provisioned in this lab, since the PIM lab has a dependency on them.
