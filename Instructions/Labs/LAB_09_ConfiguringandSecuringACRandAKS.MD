#### Task 1: Create an Azure Container Registry

In this task, you will create a resource group for the lab an an Azure Container Registry.

1. Sign-in to the Azure portal **`https://portal.azure.com/`**.

    >**Note**: Sign in to the Azure portal using an account that has the Owner or Contributor role in the Azure subscription you are using for this lab and the Global Administrator role in the Azure AD tenant associated with that subscription.

1. In the Azure portal, open the Cloud Shell by clicking the first icon in the top right of the Azure Portal. If prompted, click **Bash** and **Create storage**.

1. Ensure **Bash** is selected in the drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of the Cloud Shell pane.

1. In the Bash session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a new resource group for this lab:

    ```sh
    az group create --name AZ500LAB09 --location eastus
    ```

1. In the Bash session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to verify the resource group was created:

    ```
    az group list --query "[?name=='AZ500LAB09']" -o table
    ```

1. In the Bash session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a new Azure Container Registry (ACR) instance (The name of the ACR must be globally unique): 

    ```sh
    az acr create --resource-group AZ500LAB09 --name az500$RANDOM$RANDOM --sku Basic
    ```

1. In the Bash session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to confirm that the new ACR was created:

    ```sh
    az acr list --resource-group AZ500LAB09
    ```

    >**Note**: Record the name of the ACR. You will need it in the next task.

#### Task 2: Create a Dockerfile, build a container and push it to Azure Container Registry

In this task, you will create a Dockerfile, build an image from the Dockerfile, and deploy the image to the ACR. 

1. In the Bash session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a Dockerfile to create an Nginx-based image: 

    ```sh
    echo FROM nginx > Dockerfile
    ```

1. In the Bash session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to build an image from the Dockerfile and push the image to the new ACR. 

    >**Note**: The trailing period at the end of the command line is required. It designates the current directory as the location of Dockerfile. 

    ```sh
    ACRNAME=$(az acr list --resource-group AZ500LAB09 --query '[].{Name:name}' --output tsv)

    az acr build --image sample/nginx:v1 --registry $ACRNAME --file Dockerfile .
    ```

    >**Note**: Wait for the command to successfully complete. This might take about 2 minutes.

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **AZ500Lab09** resource group and, in the list of resources, click the entry representing the Azure Container Registry instance you provisioned in the previous task.

1. On the Container registry blade, in the **Services** section, click **Repositories**. 

1. Verify that the list of repositories includes the new container image named **sample/nginx**.

1. Click the **sample/nginx** entry and verify presence of the **v1** tag that identifies the image version.

1. Click the **v1** entry to view the image manifest.

    >**Note**: The manifest includes the sha256 digest, manifest creation date, and platform entries. 

#### Task 3: Create an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster

    |DNS name prefix|any valid, globally unique DNS host name|

    >**Note**: AKS can be configured as a private cluster. This assigns a private IP to the API server to ensure network traffic between your API server and your node pools remains on the private network only. For more information, visit [Create a private Azure Kubernetes Service cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/private-clusters) page.

1. Click **Next: Integrations >** and, on the **Integrations** tab of the **Create Kubernetes cluster** blade, set **Container monitoring** to **Disabled**. 

    >**Note**: In production scenarios, you would want to enable monitoring. Monitoring is disabled in this case since it is not covered in the lab. 

1. Click **Review + Create** and then click **Create**.

    >**Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete. This might take about 10 minutes.

1. Once the deployment completes, in the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box at the top of the Azure portal page, type **Resource groups** and press the **Enter** key.

1. On the **Resource groups** blade, in the listing of resource groups, note a new resource group named **MC_AZ500LAB09_MyKubernetesCluster_eastus** that holds components of the AKS Nodes. Review resources in this resource group. 
	
1. Navigate back to the **Resource groups** blade and click the **AZ500LAB09** entry. 

    >**Note**: In the list of resources, note the AKS Cluster and the corresponding virtual network.

1. In the Azure portal, open a Bash session in the Cloud Shell.

    kubectl get nodes
    ```

    >**Note**: Verify that the **Status** of the cluster node is listed as **Ready**.

#### Task 4: Grant the AKS cluster permissions to access the ACR and manage its virtual network

In this task, you will grant the AKS cluster permission to access the ACR and manage its virtual network. 

1. In the Bash session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to configure the AKS cluster to use the Azure Container Registry instance you created earlier in this lab. 

    ```sh
    ACRNAME=$(az acr list --resource-group AZ500LAB09 --query '[].{Name:name}' --output tsv)

    az aks update -n MyKubernetesCluster -g AZ500LAB09 --attach-acr $ACRNAME
    ```

    >**Note**: This command grants the 'acrpull' role assignment to the ACR. 

    >**Note**: It may take a few minutes for this command to complete. 

1. In the Bash session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to grant the AKS cluster the Contributor role to its virtual network.

    >**Note**: Record this IP address. You will need it in the next task. 

    >**Note**: To access the internal service endpoint, you will connect interactively to one of the pods running in the cluster. 

    >**Note**: Alternatively you could use the CLUSTER-IP address.

#### Task 8: Verify the you can access an internal AKS-hosted service

In this task, you will use one of the pods running on the AKS cluster to access the internal service. 

1. In the Bash session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to list the pods in the default namespace on the AKS cluster:

    ```sh
    kubectl get pods
    ```

1. In the listing of the pods, copy the first entry in the **NAME** column.

    >**Note**: This is the pod you will use in the subsequent steps.

1. In the Bash session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to connect interactively to the first pod (replace the `<pod_name>` placeholder with the name you copied in the previous step):

    ```sh
    kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -- /bin/bash
    ```

1. In the Bash session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to verify that the nginx web site is available via the private IP address of the service (replace the `<internal_IP>` placeholder with the IP address you recorded in the previous task):

    ```sh
    curl http://<internal_IP>
    ```

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane.

> Result: You have configured and secured ACR and AKS.
