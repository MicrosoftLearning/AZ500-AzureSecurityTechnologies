# Lab 06: Implement Directory Synchronization
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You have been asked to create a proof of concept demonstrating how to integrate on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) environment with an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. Specifically, you want to:

- Implement a single-domain AD DS forest by deploying an Azure VM hosting an AD DS domain controller
- Create and configure an Azure AD tenant
- Synchronize the AD DS forest with the Azure AD tenant

> For all the resources in this lab, we are using the **East US** region. Verify with your instructor this is the region to use for class. 

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following exercises:

- Exercise 1: Deploy an Azure VM hosting an Active Directory domain controller
- Exercise 2: Create and configure an Azure Active Directory tenant
- Exercise 3: Synchronize Active Directory forest with an Azure Active Directory tenant

### Exercise 1: Deploy an Azure VM hosting an Active Directory domain controller

### Estimated timing: 10 minutes

In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Identify an available DNS name for an Azure VM deployment
- Task 2: Use an ARM template to deploy an Azure VM hosting an Active Directory domain controller

#### Task 1: Identify an available DNS name for an Azure VM deployment

In this task, you will identify a DNS name for your Azure VM deployment. 

1. Sign-in to the Azure portal **`https://portal.azure.com/`**.

    >**Note**: Sign in to the Azure portal using an account that has the Owner or Contributor role in the Azure subscription you are using for this lab.

2. Open the Cloud Shell by clicking the first icon in the top right of the Azure Portal. If prompted, click **PowerShell** and **Create storage**.

3. Ensure **PowerShell** is selected in the drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of the Cloud Shell pane.

4. In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to identify an available DNS name you can use for an Azure VM deployment in the next task of this exercise:

    ```powershell
    Test-AzDnsAvailability -DomainNameLabel <custom-label> -Location '<location>'
    ```

    >**Note**: Replace the `<custom-label>` placeholder with a valid DNS name that is likely to be globally unique. Replace the `<location>` placeholder with the name of the region into which you want to deploy the Azure VM that will host the Active Directory domain controller you will use in this lab.

    >**Note**: To identify Azure regions where you can provision Azure VMs, refer to [**https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/offers/**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/offers/)

5. Verify that the command returned **True**. If not, rerun the same command with a different value of the `<custom-label>` until the command returns **True**.

6. Record the value of the `<custom-label>` that resulted in the successful outcome. You will need it in the next task.

7. Close the Cloud Shell.

#### Task 2: Use an ARM template to deploy an Azure VM hosting an Active Directory domain controller

In this task, you will deploy an Azure VM that will host an Active Directory domain controller

1. Open another browser tab in the same browser window and navigate to the [https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/application-workloads/active-directory/active-directory-new-domain](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/application-workloads/active-directory/active-directory-new-domain). 

2. On the **Create a new Windows VM and create a new AD Forest, Domain and DC** page, click **Deploy to Azure**. This will automatically redirect the browser to the **Create an Azure VM with a new AD Forest** blade in the Azure portal.

3. On the **Create an Azure VM with a new AD Forest** blade, click **Edit parameters**.

4. On the **Edit parameters** blade, click **Load file**, in the **Open** dialog box, navigate to the folder **\\\\AllFiles\Labs\\06\\active-directory-new-domain\\azuredeploy.parameters.json**, click **Open**, and then click **Save**. 

5. On the **Create an Azure VM with a new AD Forest** blade, specify the following settings (leave others with their existing values):

   |Setting|Value|
   |---|---|
   |Subscription|the name of you Azure subscription|
   |Resource group|click **Create new** and type the name **AZ500LAB06**|
   |Region|the Azure region you identified in the previous task|
   |Admin Username|**Student**|
   |Admin Password|**Pa55w.rd1234**|
   |Domain Name|**adatum.com**|
   |Dns Prefix|the DNS hostname you identified in the previous task|
   |VM Size|**Standard_D2s_v3**|

6. On the **Create an Azure VM with a new AD Forest** blade, click **Review + create**, and then click **Create**.

    >**Note**: Do not wait for the deployment to complete but instead proceed to the next exercise. The deployment might take about 15 minutes. You will use the virtual machine deployed in this task in the third exercise of this lab.

> Result: After you completed this exercise, you have initiated deployment of an Azure VM that will host an Active Directory domain controller by using an Azure Resource Manager template


### Exercise 2: Create and configure an Azure Active Directory tenant 

### Estimated timing: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Create an Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant
- Task 2: Add a custom DNS name to the new Azure AD tenant
- Task 3: Create an Azure AD user with the Global Administrator role

#### Task 1: Create an Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant

In this task, you will create a new Azure AD tenant to use in this lab. 

1. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box at the top of the Azure portal page, type **Azure Active Directory** and press the **Enter** key.

2. On the blade displaying **Overview** of your current Azure AD tenant, click **Manage tenant**, and then on the next screen, click **+ Create**.

3. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create a directory** blade, ensure that the option **Azure Active Directory** is selected and click **Next: Configuration >**.

4. On the **Configuration** tab of the **Create a directory** blade, specify the following settings:

   |Setting|Value|
   |---|---|
   |Organization name|**AdatumSync**|
   |Initial domain name|a unique name consisting of a combination of letters and digits|
   |Country or region|**United States**|

    >**Note**: Record the initial domain name. You will need it later in this lab.

    >**Note**: The green check mark in the **Initial domain name** text box will indicate whether the domain name you typed in is valid and unique. (Record your initial domain name for later use).

5. Click **Review + create** and then click **Create**.

    >**Note**: Wait for the new tenant to be created. Use the **Notification** icon to monitor the deployment status. 

#### Task 2: Add a custom DNS name to the new Azure AD tenant

In this task, you will add your custom DNS name to the new Azure AD tenant. 

1. In the Azure portal, in the toolbar, click the **Directory + subscription** icon, located to the right of the Cloud Shell icon. 

2. In the **Directory + subscription** blade, select the newly created tenant **AdatumSync** line and click the **Switch** button.

    >**Note**: You may need to refresh the browser window if the **AdatumSync** entry does not appear in the **Directory + subscription** filter list.

3. On the **AdatumSync \| Azure Active Directory** blade, in the **Manage** section, click **Custom domain names**.

4. On the **AdatumSync \| Custom domain names** blade, click **+ Add custom domain**.

5. On the **Custom domain name** blade, in the **Custom domain name** text box, type **adatum.com** and click **Add Domain**.

6. On the **adatum.com** blade, review the information necessary to perform verification of the Azure AD domain name. 

    >**Note**: You will not be able to complete the validation process because you do not own the **adatum.com** DNS domain name. This will not prevent you from synchronizing the **adatum.com** AD DS domain with the Azure AD tenant. You will use for this purpose the initial DNS name of the Azure AD tenant (the name ending with the **onmicrosoft.com** suffix), which you identified in the previous task. However, keep in mind that, as a result, the DNS domain name of the AD DS domain and the DNS name of the Azure AD tenant will differ. This means that Adatum users will need to use different names when signing in to the AD DS domain and when signing in to Azure AD tenant.

#### Task 3: Create an Azure AD user with the Global Administrator role

In this task, you will add a new Azure AD user and assign them to the Global Administrator role. 

1. On the **AdatumSync** Azure AD tenant blade, in the **Manage** section, click **Users**.

2. On the **Users \| All users (Preview)** blade, click **+ New User**. 

3. On the **New user** blade, ensure that the **Create user** option is selected, specify the following settings (leave all others with their default values) and click **Create**:

   |Setting|Value|
   |---|---|
   |User name|**syncadmin**|
   |Name|**syncadmin**|
   |Password|ensure that the option **Auto-generate password** is selected and click **Show Password**|
   |Groups|**0 groups selected**|
   |Roles|click **User**, then click **Global administrator**, and click **Select**|
   |Usage Location|**United States**|  

    >**Note**: Record the full user name. You can copy its value by clicking the **Copy to clipboard** button on the right hand side of the drop-down list displaying the domain name. 

    >**Note**: Record the user's password. You will need this later in this lab. 

    >**Note**: An Azure AD user with the Global Administrator role is required in order to implement Azure AD Connect.

4. Open an InPrivate browser window.

5. Navigate to the Azure portal and sign in using the **syncadmin** user account. When prompted, change the password you recorded earlier in this task to **Pa55w.rd1234**.

    >**Note**: To sign in you will need to provide a fully qualified name of the **syncadmin** user account, including the Azure AD tenant DNS domain name, which you recorded earlier in this task. This user name is in the format syncadmin@`<your_tenant_name>`.onmicrosoft.com, where `<your_tenant_name>` is the placeholder representing your unique Azure AD tenant name. 

6. Sign out as **syncadmin** and close the InPrivate browser window.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have created an Azure AD tenant, added a custom DNS name to the new Azure AD tenant, and created an Azure AD user with the Global Administrator role.

    Install-Module MsOnline -Force
    ```

3. From the Windows PowerShell console, connect to the AdatumSync Azure AD tenant by running the following (when prompted, sign in with the **syncadmin** credentials):

    ```powershell
    Connect-MsolService
    ```

4. From the Windows PowerShell console, disable the Azure AD Connect synchronization by running the following:

    ```powershell
    Set-MsolDirSyncEnabled -EnableDirSync $false -Force
    ```

5. From the Windows PowerShell console, verify that the operation was successful by running the following:

    ```powershell
    (Get-MSOLCompanyInformation).DirectorySynchronizationEnabled
    ```
    >**Note**: The result should be `False`. If that is not the case, wait a minute and re-run the command.

    >**Note**: Next, remove the Azure resources
6. Close the Remote desktop session.

7. In the Azure portal, set the **Directory + subscription** filter to the Azure AD tenant associated with the Azure subscription into which you deployed the **adVM** Azure VM.

8. In the Azure portal, open the Cloud Shell by clicking the first icon in the top right of the Azure Portal. 

9. In the drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of the Cloud Shell pane, select **PowerShell**, and, when prompted, click **Confirm**. 

10. In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to remove the resource group you created in this lab:
  
    ```powershell
    Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "AZ500LAB06" -Force -AsJob
    ```
11. Close the **Cloud Shell** pane.

    >**Note**: Finally, remove the Azure AD tenant
    
    >**Note 2**: Deleting a tenant is meant to be a very hard process, so it can never accidentally or maliciously be done.  That means that removing the tenant as part of this lab often does not work.  While we have the steps here to delete the tenant, it is not required to consider yourself as completing this lab. If you ever have a need to remove a tenant in the real world, there are articles on DOCS.Microsoft.com to help you.

12. Back in the Azure portal, use the **Directory + subscription** filter to switch to the **AdatumSync** Azure Active Directory tenant.

13. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Users - All users** blade, click the entry representing the **syncadmin** user account, on the **syncadmin - Profile** blade click **Delete**, and, when prompted to confirm, click **Yes**.

14. Repeat the same sequence of steps to delete the **aduser1** user account.

15. Navigate to the **AdatumSync - Overview** blade of the Azure AD tenant, click **Manage tenants** and select the check box of the **AdatumSync** directory, click **Delete**, on the **Delete tenant 'AdatumSync'** blade, click the **Get permission to delete Azure resources** link, on the **Properties** blade of Azure Active Directory, set **Access management for Azure resources** to **Yes** and click **Save**.

**Note**: While deleting if you receive any warning sign like **Delete all users** then proceed to delete the users that you have created or if the warning sign says **Delete LinkedIn applications**  click on the warning message and confirm the deletion of the LinkedIn application, all the warning need to be addressed to pass the deletion of the tenant.

16. Sign out from the Azure portal and sign in back. 

17. Navigate back to the **Delete tenant 'AdatumSync'** blade and click **Delete**.
