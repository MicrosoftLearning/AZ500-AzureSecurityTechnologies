# Lab 15: Azure Sentinel
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You have been asked to create a proof of concept of Azure Sentinel-based threat detection and response. Specifically, you want to:

- Start collecting data from Azure Activity and Security Center.
- Add built in and custom alerts 
- Review how Playbooks can be used to automate a response to an incident.

> For all the resources in this lab, we are using the **East US** region. Verify with your instructor this is the region to use for class. 

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following exercise:

- Exercise 1: Implement Azure Sentinel

## Lab files:

- **\\Allfiles\\Labs\\15\\changeincidentseverity.json**

### Exercise 1: Implement Azure Sentinel

### Estimated timing: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: On-board Azure Sentinel
- Task 2: Connect Azure Activity to Sentinel
- Task 3: Create a rule that uses the Azure Activity data connector. 
- Task 4: Create a playbook
- Task 5: Create a custom alert and configure the playbook as an automated response.
- Task 6: Invoke an incident and review the associated actions.

#### Task 1: On-board Azure Sentinel

In this task, you will on-board Azure Sentinel and connect the Log Analytics workspace. 

1. Sign-in to the Azure portal **`https://portal.azure.com/`**.

    >**Note**: Sign in to the Azure portal using an account that has the Owner or Contributor role in the Azure subscription you are using for this lab.

1. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box at the top of the Azure portal page, type **Azure Sentinel** and press the **Enter** key.

1. On the **Azure Sentinel** blade, click **+ New**.

1. On the **Add Azure Sentinel to a workspace** blade, select the Log Analytics workspace you created in the Azure Monitor lab and click **Add**.

    >**Note**: Azure Sentinel has very specific requirements for workspaces. For example, workspaces created by Azure Security Center can not be used. Read more at [Quickstart: On-board Azure Sentinel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/quickstart-onboard)
	
#### Task 2: Configure Azure Sentinel to use the Azure Activity data connector. 

In this task, you will configure Sentinel to use the Azure Activity data connector.  

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Azure Sentinel \| Overview** blade, in the **Configuration** section, click **Data connectors**. 

1. On the **Azure Sentinel \| Data connectors** blade, review the list of available connectors, click the entry representing the **Azure Activity** connector (scroll to the right if needed), review its description, and then click **Open connector page**.

1. On the **Azure Activity** blade, click the **Configure Azure Activity logs** link.

1. On the **Azure Activity log** blade, click the entry representing the Azure subscription you are using in this lab and then click **Connect**.

1. Navigate back to the **Azure Sentinel \| Data connectors** blade and click **Refresh**.

1. On the **Azure Sentinel \| Data connectors** blade, click **Azure Activity**. 

1. Setting up the new Azure Activity log connector has two stages:

Step 1 Disconnect the existing subscriptions from the legacy method.

Step 2 Connection of all relevant subscriptions to the new diagnostics settings pipeline using Azure policy.

Disconnect from old pipeline
From the Azure Sentinel navigation menu, select Data connectors. From the list of connectors, select Azure Activity, and then click the Open connector page button on the lower right.

Under the Instructions tab, in the Configuration section, in step 1, review the list of your existing subscriptions that are connected to the legacy method (so you know which ones to add to the new), and disconnect them all at once by clicking the Disconnect All button below.

Connect to new pipeline
Under step 2, select the Launch Azure Policy Assignment wizard button. The policy assignment wizard will open, ready to create a new policy called Configure Azure Activity logs to stream to specified Log Analytics workspace.

In the Basics tab, click the button with the three dots under Scope to open the Scope panel where you select your subscription (and, optionally, a resource group). You can also add a description.

In the Parameters tab, leave the Effect and Enable logs fields as is. Choose your Azure Sentinel workspace from the Log Analytics workspace drop-down list.

The policy will be applied to resources added in the future. To apply the policy on your existing resources as well, select the Remediation tab and mark the Create a remediation task check box.

In the Review + create tab, click Create. Your policy is now assigned to the scope you chose.
 >**Note**: The policy compliance and remediation task may take upto 15 minutes once it is done you will see one connector under connected.
2. Verify that the **Azure Activity** pane displays the **Data received** graph (you might have to refresh the browser page). 

    >**Note**: It may take over 5 minutes before the graph will reflect the any events included in the Azure Activity logs.

#### Task 3: Create a rule that uses the Azure Activity data connector. 

In this task, you will review and create a rule that uses the Azure Activity data connector. 

1. On the **Azure Sentinel \| Configuration** blade, click **Analytics**. 

1. On the **Azure Sentinel \| Analytics** blade, click the **Rule templates** tab. 

    >**Note**: Review the types of rules you can create. Each rule is associated with a specific Data Source.

1. In the listing of rule templates, type **Suspicious** into the search bar form and click the **Suspicious number of resource creation or deployment** entry associated with the **Azure Activity** data source. And then, in the pane displaying the rule template properties, click **Create rule** (scroll to the right of the page if needed).

    >**Note**: This rule has the medium severity. 

1. On the **General** tab of the **Analytic rule wizard - Create new rule from template** blade, accept the default settings and click **Next: Set rule logic >**.

1. On the **Set rule logic** tab of the **Analytic rule wizard - Create new rule from template** blade, accept the default settings and click **Next: Incident settings >**.

1. On the **Incident settings** tab of the **Analytic rule wizard - Create new rule from template** blade, accept the default settings and click **Next: Automated response >**. 

    >**Note**: This is where you can add a playbook, implemented as a Logic App, to a rule to automate the remediation of an issue.

1. On the **Automated response** tab of the **Analytic rule wizard - Create new rule from template** blade, accept the default settings and click **Next: Review >**. 

1. On the **Review and create** tab of the **Analytic rule wizard - Create new rule from template** blade, click **Create**.

    >**Note**: You now have an active rule.

#### Task 4: Create a playbook

In this task, you will create a playbook. A security playbook is a collection of tasks that can be invoked by Azure Sentinel in response to an alert. 

1. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box at the top of the Azure portal page, type **Deploy a custom template** and press the **Enter** key.

    ```
    AzureActivity
     | where ResourceProviderValue =~ "Microsoft.Security" 
     | where OperationNameValue =~ "Microsoft.Security/locations/jitNetworkAccessPolicies/delete" 
    ```

    >**Note**: This rule identifies removal of Just in time VM access policies.

    >**Note** if you receive a parse error, intellisense may have added values to your query. Ensure the query matches otherwise paste the query into notepad and then from notepad to the rule query. 


1. On the **Set rule logic** tab of the **Analytic rule wizard - Create new rule** blade, in the **Query scheduling** section, set the **Run query every** to **5 Minutes**.

1. On the **Set rule logic** tab of the **Analytic rule wizard - Create new rule** blade, accept the default values of the remaining settings and click **Next: Incident settings >**.

1. On the **Incident settings** tab of the **Analytic rule wizard - Create new rule** blade, accept the default settings and click **Next: Automated response >**. 

1. On the **Automated response** tab of the **Analytic rule wizard - Create new rule** blade, in the **Alert automation** dropdown list, select the checkbox next to the **Change-Incident-Severity** entry and click **Next: Review >**. 

1. On the **Review and create** tab of the **Analytic rule wizard - Create new rule** blade, click **Create**.

    >**Note**: You now have a new active rule called **Playbook Demo**. If an event identified by the rue logic occurs, it will result in a medium severity alert, which will generate a corresponding incident.

#### Task 6: Invoke an incident and review the associated actions.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Security Center \| Overview** blade.

    >**Note**: Check your secure score. By now it should have updated. 

1. On the **Security Center \| Azure Defender** blade, click **Just-in-time vm access** section.

1. On the **Security Center \| Just in time VM access** blade, on the right hand side of the row referencing the **myVM** virtual machine, click the **ellipses** button,  click **Remove** and then click **Yes**.

1. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box at the top of the Azure portal page, type **Activity log** and press the **Enter** key.

1. Navigate to the **Activity log** blade, note an **Delete JIT Network Access Policies** entry. 

    >**Note**: This may take a minute to appear. 

1. In the Azure portal, navigate back to the **Azure Sentinel \| Overview** blade.

1. On the **Azure Sentinel \| Overview** blade, review the dashboard and verify that it displays an alert corresponding to the deletion of the Just in time VM access policy.

    >**Note**: It can take up to 5 minutes for alerts to appear on the **Azure Sentinel \| Overview** blade. If you are not seeing an alert at that point, run the query rule referenced in the previous task to verify that the Just In Time access policy deletion activity has been propagated to the Log Analytics workspace associated with your Azure Sentinel instance. If that is not the case, re-create the Just in time VM access policy and delete it again.

1. On the **Azure Sentinel \| Overview** blade, in the **Threat Management** section, click **Incidents**.

1. Verify that the blade displays an incident with either medium or high severity level.

    >**Note**: It can take up to 5 minutes for the incident to appear on the **Azure Sentinel \| Incidents** blade. 

    >**Note**: Review the **Azure Sentinel \| Playbooks** blade. You will find there the count of succesfull and failed runs.

    >**Note**: You have the option of assigning a different severity level and status to an incident.

> Results: You have created an Azure Sentinel workspace, connected it to Azure Activity logs, created a playbook and custom alerts that are triggered in response to the removal of Just in time VM access policies, and verified that the configuration is valid.

**Clean up resources**

> Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not incur unexpected costs. 

1. In the Azure portal, open the Cloud Shell by clicking the first icon in the top right of the Azure Portal. If prompted, click **PowerShell** and **Create storage**.

1. Ensure **PowerShell** is selected in the drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of the Cloud Shell pane.

1. In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to remove the resource group you created in this lab:
  
    ```powershell
    Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "AZ500LAB131415" -Force -AsJob
    ```
1. Close the **Cloud Shell** pane.
