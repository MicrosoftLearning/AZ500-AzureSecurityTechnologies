# Lab 14: Microsoft Defender for Cloud
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You have been asked to create a proof of concept of Microsoft Defender for Cloud-based environment. Specifically, you want to:

- Configure Microsoft Defender for Cloud to monitor a virtual machine.
- Review Microsoft Defender for Cloud recommendations for the virtual machine.
- Implement recommendations for guest configuration and Just in time VM access. 
- Review how the Secure Score can be used to determine progress toward creating a more secure infrastructure.

> For all the resources in this lab, we are using the **East US** region. Verify with your instructor this is the region to use for class. 

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following exercise:

- Exercise 1: Implement Microsoft Defender for Cloud

## Instructions

### Exercise 1: Implement Microsoft Defender for Cloud

In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Configure Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- Task 2: Review the Microsoft Defender for Cloud recommendations
- Task 3: Implement the Microsoft Defender for Cloud recommendation to enable Just in time VM Access

#### Task 1: Configure Microsoft Defender for Cloud

In this task, you will on-board and configure Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

1. Sign-in to the Azure portal **`https://portal.azure.com/`**.

    >**Note**: Sign in to the Azure portal using an account that has the Owner or Contributor role in the Azure subscription you are using for this lab.

2. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box at the top of the Azure portal page, type **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** and press the **Enter** key.

3. If it hasn't been completed previously, on the **Microsoft Defender for Cloud \| Getting started** blade, click **Upgrade**.
     
4. If it hasn't been completed previously, on the **Microsoft Defender for Cloud \| Getting started** blade, in the **Install agents** tab, scroll down and click **Install agents**.

5. On the **Microsoft Defender for Cloud \| Getting started** blade, on the **Upgrade** tab >> in the **Select workspaces with enhanced security features** section >> turn on the **Microsoft Defender plan** by selecting your Log Analytics Workspace. 

    >**Note**: Review all the features that are available as part of Microsoft Defender plans. 

6. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** and click **Environment Settings** under the Management settings, in the vertical menu bar on the left side.

7. On the **Microsoft Defender for Cloud | Environment Settings** blade, click the relevant subscription. 

8. On the **Defender plans** blade, select **Enable all Microsoft Defender for Cloud Plans** and click **Save**.

9. On the **Settings | Defender plans** blade, in the vertical menu on the left side, click **Auto provisioning**.

10. On the **Settings | Auto provisioning**  blade, make sure that Auto provisioning is set to **On** for the first item **Log Analytics agent for Azure VMs**.

11. On the **Settings \| Workflow automation** blade, click **+ Add workflow automation**.

12. On the **Add workflow automation** blade, review the available settings. 

    >**Note**: You can trigger actions based threat detection alerts and Microsoft Defender for Cloud recommendations. You can also configure an action based on Logic apps. 

13. On the **Add workflow automation** blade, click **Cancel**.

    >**Note**: Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides many insights into virtual machines including system update status, OS security configurations, and endpoint protection.

14. Navigate back to the **Microsoft Defender for Cloud \| Environment Settings** blade, expand your subscription, and click the entry representing the Log Analytics workspace you created in the previous lab.

15. On the **Settings \| Defender plans** blade, ensure that **Enable all Microsoft Defender for Cloud plans** is selected and click **Save**.

16. Select **Data collection** from the **Microsoft Defender for Cloud \| Settings** blade. Select **All Events** and **Save**.


#### Task 2: Review the Microsoft Defender for Cloud recommendation

In this task, you will review the Microsoft Defender for Cloud recommendations. 

1. In the Azure portal, navigate back to the **Microsoft Defender for Cloud \| Overview** blade. 

2. On the **Microsoft Defender for Cloud \| Overview** blade, review the **Secure Score** tile.

    >**Note**: Record the current score if it is available.

3. Navigate back to the **Microsoft Defender for Cloud \| Overview** blade, select **Assessed resources**.

4. On the **Inventory** blade, select the **myVM** entry.

    >**Note**: You might have to wait a few minutes and refresh the browser page for the entry to appear.
    
5. On the **Resource health** blade, on the **Recommendations** tab, review the list of recommendations for **myVM**.


#### Task 3: Implement the Microsoft Defender for Cloud recommendation to enable Just in time VM Access

In this task, you will implement the Microsoft Defender for Cloud recommendation to enable Just in time VM Access on the virtual machine. 

1. In the Azure portal, navigate back to the **Microsoft Defender for Cloud \| Overview** blade and select the **Workload protections** under **Cloud Security** tile.

2. On the **Workload protections** blade, in the **Advanced protection** section, click the **Just-in-time VM access** tile and, on the **Just-in-time VM access blade**, click **Try Just in time VM access**.

    >**Note**: If the VMs are not listed, navigate to **Virtual Machine** blade and click the **Configuration**, Click the **Enable the Just-in-time VMs** option under the **Just-in-time Vm's access**. Repeat the above step to navigate back to the **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** and refresh the page, the VM will appear.

3. On the **Just in time VM access**, select **Not Configured** and then click the **myVM** entry.

    >**Note**: You might have to wait a few minutes before the **myVM** entry becomes available.

4. Select **Enable JIT on 1 VM**.

5. On the **JIT VM access configuration** blade, on the far right of the row referencing the port **22**, click the ellipsis button and then click **Delete**.

6. On the **JIT VM access configuration** blade, click **Save**.

    >**Note**: Monitor the progress of configuration by clicking on the **Notifications** icon in the toolbar and viewing the **Notifications** blade. 

    >**Note**: It can take some time for the implementation of recommendations in this lab to be reflected by Secure Score. Periodically check the Secure Score to determine the impact of implementing these features. 

> Results: You have on-boarded Microsoft Defender for Cloud and implemented virtual machine recommendations. 

    >**Note**: Do not remove the resources from this lab as they are needed for the Azure Sentinel lab.
