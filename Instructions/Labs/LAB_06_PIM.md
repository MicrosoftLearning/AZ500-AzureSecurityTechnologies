# Lab 06: Azure AD Privileged Identity Management
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You have been asked to create a proof of concept that uses Azure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to enable just-in-time administration and control the number of users who can perform privileged operations. The specific requirements are:

- Create a permanent assignment of the aaduser2 Azure AD user to the Security Administrator role. 
- Configure the aaduser2 Azure AD user to be eligible for the Billing Administrator and Global Reader roles.
- Configure the Global Reader role activation to require an approval of the aaduser3 Azure AD user
- Configure an access review of the Global Reader role and review auditing capabilities.

> For all the resources in this lab, we are using the **East US** region. Verify with your instructor this is the region to use for class. 

> Before you proceed, ensure that you have completed Lab 04: MFA, Conditional Access and AAD Identity Protection . You will need the Azure AD tenant, AdatumLab500-04, and the aaduser1, aaduser2, and aaduser3 user accounts.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following exercises:

- Exercise 1: Configure PIM users and roles.
- Exercise 2: Activate PIM roles with and without approval.
- Exercise 3: Create an Access Review and review PIM auditing features.

> Result: You have configured an access review and reviewed audit information. 

**Clean up resources**

> Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not incur unexpected costs. 

1. In the Azure portal, set the **Directory + subscription** filter to the the Azure AD tenant associated with the Azure subscription into which you deployed the **az500-04-vm1** Azure VM.

    >**Note**: If you don't see your main Azure AD tenant entry, click on the Switch Diretory link, select your main tenant line and click the Switch button.

2. In the Azure portal, open the Cloud Shell by clicking the first icon in the top right of the Azure Portal. If prompted, click **PowerShell** and **Create storage**.

3. Ensure **PowerShell** is selected in the drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of the Cloud Shell pane.

4. In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to remove the resource group you created in the previous lab:
  
    ```powershell
    Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "AZ500LAB04" -Force -AsJob
    ```

5. Close the **Cloud Shell** pane. 

6. Back in the Azure portal, use the **Directory + subscription** filter to switch to the **AdatumLab500-04** Azure Active Directory tenant.

7. Navigate to the **AdatumLab500-04 Azure Active Directory** blade and, in the **Manage** section, click **Licenses**.

8. On the **Licenses** | Overview blade, click **All products**, select the checkbox of **Azure Active Directory Premium P2** and click it to open.

    >**Note**: In the Lab 4 - Exercise 2 - Task 4 **Assign Azure AD Premium P2 licenses to Azure AD users** was to assign the Premium Licenses to the users **aaduser1, aaduser2, and aaduser3**, make sure we remove those licenses from the assigned users

9. On the **Azure Active Directory Premium P2 - Licensed users** blade, select the checkboxes of the user accounts to which you assigned **Azure Active Directory Premium P2** licenses. Click **Remove license** from the top pane and when prompted to confirm, select **Yes**.

10. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Users - All users** blade, click the entry representing the **aaduser1** user account, on the **aaduser1 - Profile** blade click **Delete**, and, when prompted to confirm, select **Yes**.

11. Repeat the same sequence of steps to delete the remaining user accounts you created.

12. Navigate to the **AdatumLab500-04 - Overview** blade of the Azure AD tenant, select **Manage tenants** and then on the next screen, select the checkbox next to **AdatumLab500-04** and select **Delete**. On the **Delete tenant 'AdatumLab500-04'** blade, select **Get permission to delete Azure resources** link, on the **Properties** blade of Azure Active Directory, set **Access management for Azure resources** to **Yes** and select **Save**.

13. Sign out from the Azure portal and sign in back. 

14. Navigate back to the **Delete directory 'AdatumLab500-04'** blade and click **Delete**.

    >**Note**: Still not able to delete the tenant and throwing an error **Delete all license-based and subscriptions**, then it might be due to any subscriptions that have been linked to the tenant. Here **Free Premium P2 license** could be throwing the validation error. Deleting the trial subscription of the Premium P2 License using the Global admin id from the M365 admin>> **Your Products** and from the **Business Store** portal would solve this issue. Also note that deleting the tenant takes more time. Check the End date of the subscription, once after the end of the trial period, revisit the Azure Active directory and then try to delete the tenant.
